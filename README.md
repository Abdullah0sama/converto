# replicalist


replicalist is a website to help you replicate a playlist on another streaming service. It can be used if you want to send a playlist to someone who doesn't use the same streaming service as you or you were sent one or even if you are migrating from your current streaming service and you don't want to leave your playlists behind.

Currently the website supports replicating from and to:

    -Spotify
    -Deezer
